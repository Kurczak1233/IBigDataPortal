The portal administration has reached MVP point of the development.

From now on the process will consists on implementing features which give business value into the project and are required by the users.
The users / testers give feedback and annotations about the page flow and functionalities.
Some bugs may be still found due to the minor limit of the human resources.

MVP 1.0
On the portal you are able to overlook the posts that are divided in 3 categories: Job offers, posts, edu links. Posts may be available to see for unregisted user.
There is a comment system implemented. Only the registered users can comment the posts. Commenting may be restricted by post owner / adminstration, so not every post may be able to be commented.
There are a few roles on the portal like: Administrators, HEI, Employee, Users. Depending on the role the user is able to perform actions on the platform.
In order to gain higher access to the portal the user can send a request to the administration.
The posts can contain images.
From the administration site, there are invitations to overlook, articles that can be edited an maintained, users management, user edit.

In the future:
There are plenty smaller issues that can be easily improved.
- Simple filtration system for administrations lists.
- Responsiveness of the application
- Documents for articles
- User page administration access for the users and everybody in order to implement profile pictures in the commenting sections.
- Role pop up or note that informs user about his current role. (maybe with come colours).
- Removing filters from the already filtered items.
... and whenever needed bug fixes.

Stay tuned for MMP 1.0!
